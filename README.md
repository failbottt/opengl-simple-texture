### What is this?

This is an example using OpenGL to:

1. Load a texture
2. Render subsections of the texture to the screen

This requires GLFW and that's included in `/external/glfw`.

I've only built this on Linux. If you're on another platform you'll 
have to compile glfw for your platform. You can read how to do that here:
https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.0/compile.html

### To run
`make && ./exe`
